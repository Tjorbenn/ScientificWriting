# Summary
The paradoxon that caffeine has no effect or even decreases wakefulness is commonly described by Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients as well as some healthy individuals.
Paradoxical effects of caffeine in disorders of the dopaminergic / noradrenergic systems, like ADHD, may hint at non-stimulatory interactions of caffeine in these systems or adjacent neuronal pathways.
We found a statistically significant difference in the effect of caffeine intake on the perceived wakefulness of ADHD patients and healthy individuals using a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, showing no mean increase in perceived wakefulness for ADHD patients.
These findings lay the ground work for molecular investigations into the interactions of caffeine and the dopaminergic / noradrenergic systems, especially in disorders involving these neuronal pathways, and may even contribute to further our understanding of the biochemical basis of these disorders on a neurological level.

# Introduction
ADHD is one of the most widespread neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide. [@abdelnourADHDDiagnosticTrends2022]
The current hypothesis for the neurobiochemical basis of ADHD is a disregulation of the dopamine / noradrenalin levels in certain brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, leading to executive dysfunction and other associated symptoms. [@purper-ouakilNeurobiologyAttentionDeficit2011]
This is where the first-line treatment option of stimulant medication takes effect by increasing the levels of the affected neurotransmitters to physiological normal levels. [@mechlerEvidencebasedPharmacologicalTreatment2022]

Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug worldwide and belongs, just like most ADHD medication, to the category of stimulants. [@ferreCaffeineSubstanceUse2013]
This leads to many ADHD patients as well as individuals with undiagnosed ADHD to self-medicate with caffeine, as it has an overlapping effect spectrum with commonly prescribed ADHD medication. [@agostonSelfMedicationADHDSymptoms2022]

Paradoxically many ADHD patients (some healthy individuals as well) experience no increased wakefulness or even a tiring effect of caffeine. [@WhyDoesCoffee2021]
One proposed hypothesis for this paradoxical effect is that the stimulating effect of caffeine decreases the neurotransmitter imbalance present in ADHD patients, decreasing self-stimulating behaviour like racing thoughts or hyperactivity, promoting calmness and as a result tiredness. [@consultingWhyDoesCoffee2023]

However besides hypotheses, the paradoxical effects of caffeine in individuals with ADHD remain poorly understood and could not be proven until now.
Here we show, using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, that ADHD patients do not show statistically significant increased alertness from caffeine consumption, while healthy individuals do.
These findings will help understand the neurobiochemical basis of ADHD and further our understanding on why and how stimulant medication can be used to alleviate ADHD symptoms.

# Methods

# Results

To investigate a possible correlation between the neurobiochemistry of ADHD and
the effect of caffeine on perceived wakefulness, we recruited twelve healthy
individuals and twelve individuals diagnosed with ADHD. Both groups were equally
split into a group that was administered 30 mg of caffeine in the form of coffee
and a group that was given the same amount of decaffeinated coffee, minimizing
the possible effects of other compounds on our measured parameter.

Our measurements revealed a significant correlation between caffeine intake and
perceived wakefulness in healthy individuals (average increase of $30 \%$, $p =
0.005$) while not showing any significant differences for the group of ADHD
patients (no increase / decrease, $p = 0.81$) as shown in @fig-plot. This has
also been corroborated by previous studies. [@leonEffectsCaffeineCognitive2000]

In summary, we found that neurotypical individuals display a significant
stimulatory response to oral caffeine consumption while individuals with ADHD
did not show signs of increased wakefulness after intake of 30 mg of caffeine.
