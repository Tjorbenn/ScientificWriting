# Summary
The paradoxon that caffeine has no effect or even decreases wakefulness is commonly described by Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients as well as some healthy individuals.
Paradoxical effects of caffeine in disorders of the dopaminergic / noradrenergic systems, like ADHD, may hint at non-stimulatory interactions of caffeine in these systems or adjacent neuronal pathways.
We found a statistically significant difference in the effect of caffeine intake on the perceived wakefulness of ADHD patients and healthy individuals using a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, showing no mean increase in perceived wakefulness for ADHD patients.
These findings lay the ground work for molecular investigations into the interactions of caffeine and the dopaminergic / noradrenergic systems, especially in disorders involving these neuronal pathways, and may even contribute to further our understanding of the biochemical basis of these disorders on a neurological level.

# Introduction
Caffeine is the most consumed drug worldwide as of 2019.
ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide.
Therefore many people with ADHD consume caffeine.
Caffeine seems to have paradoxical effects in patients with ADHD.

# Methods

# Results

To investigate a possible correlation between the neurobiochemistry of ADHD and
the effect of caffeine on perceived wakefulness, we recruited twelve healthy
individuals and twelve individuals diagnosed with ADHD. Both groups were equally
split into a group that was administered 30 mg of caffeine in the form of coffee
and a group that was given the same amount of decaffeinated coffee, minimizing
the possible effects of other compounds on our measured parameter.

Our measurements revealed a significant correlation between caffeine intake and
perceived wakefulness in healthy individuals (average increase of $30 \%$, $p =
0.005$) while not showing any significant differences for the group of ADHD
patients (no increase / decrease, $p = 0.81$) as shown in @fig-plot. This has
also been corroborated by previous studies. [@leon_effects_2000]

In summary, we found that neurotypical individuals display a significant
stimulatory response to oral caffeine consumption while individuals with ADHD
did not show signs of increased wakefulness after intake of 30 mg of caffeine.
