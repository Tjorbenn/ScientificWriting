  abstract = {{$<$}sec{$><$}title{$>$}Objective{$<$}/title{$><$}p{$>$}Stimulants are the most effective treatment for Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, studies have shown that nicotine dependence in patients with ADHD is probably best explained by self-medication. The question is whether this is also true for caffeine use and caffeine dependence. The aim of our study was, therefore, to examine the relationship of ADHD symptoms, caffeine consumption, caffeine use disorder (CUD) and well-being. We hypothesized that those who have more ADHD symptoms and regularly consume caffeine have higher psychological well-being than those who have more ADHD symptoms, but do not consume caffeine.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$><$}sec{$><$}title{$>$}Methods{$<$}/title{$><$}p{$>$}A general population sample ({$<$}italic{$>$}N{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 2,259, 70.5\% male, mean age 34.0) filled out the 10-item Caffeine Use Disorder Questionnaire (CUDQ), the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale (ASRS) and the WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and were asked about their caffeine consumption habits in an online survey.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$><$}sec{$><$}title{$>$}Results{$<$}/title{$><$}p{$>$}There were no associations between ADHD and coffee, tea, energy drink or cola consumption or daily caffeine consumption.

  abstract = {Caffeine's therapeutic effects have been widely investigated; it has been featured as an important independent variable in psychopharmacological research and has been regarded as a promising addition to the class of stimulant medications. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the common diagnoses targeted by caffeine researchers. A review of the research methodology applied to understanding the effects of caffeine on ADHD is presented here. This provides researchers with methodological options for investigating the effects of caffeine on other disorders. The focus of this review is not in evaluating the effectiveness of caffeine on ADHD, but rather to describe the experimental methods from which those results were derived. This review will highlight methodology, including participants, preparation of caffeine, dose, methods of administration, dependent measures, and various experimental designs employed.}

For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning. Methylphenidate was more effective than caffeine in decreasing hyperactivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning and motor coordination. Amphetamines were more effective than caffeine in reducing hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression, and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity. Combining caffeine and stimulants to produce moderate levels of arousal may produce better functioning than caffeine or stimulant drugs alone. Research is needed regarding caffeine's effects on the functioning of adolescents and adults with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, causing functional impairment. Its prevalence lies at approximately 5\% in children and adolescents and at approximately 2.5\% in adults. The disorder follows a multifactorial etiology and shows a high heritability. Patients show a high interindividual and intraindividual variability of symptoms, with executive deficits in several cognitive domains. Overall, ADHD is associated with high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, and insufficient treatment is linked to adverse long-term outcomes. Current clinical guidelines recommend an individualized multimodal treatment approach including psychoeducation, pharmacological interventions, and non-pharmacological interventions. Available medications include stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine). While available pharmacological treatment options for ADHD show relatively large effect sizes (in short-term trials) and overall good tolerability, there is still a need for improvement of current pharmacotherapeutic strategies and for the development of novel medications. This review summarizes available pharmacological treatment options for ADHD in children and adolescents, identifies current issues in research and evidence gaps, and provides an overview of ongoing efforts to develop new medications for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents by means of a systematic cross-sectional analysis of the clinical trials registry www.clinicaltrials.gov.},

  abstract = {(1) Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is typically treated with stimulant medications, which may lead to several adverse effects. Recent animal studies have shown that caffeine can improve the symptoms of ADHD. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to evaluate the effect of caffeine on ADHD symptoms in children. (2) Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing caffeine with placebo in children, comparing overall symptoms of ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. (3) Results: We included seven RCTs in the systematic review for qualitative assessment, with 104 patients aged 5 to 15 years. Four of these studies (n = 76) were included in the meta-analysis. After qualitative analysis, four studies indicated no improvement in any of the ADHD symptoms compared with placebo. One study showed improvement in ADHD symptoms based on 1 of 5 scales applied. One study indicated significant improvement in general symptoms, inattention, and hyperactivity. One study indicated improvement in sustained attention but a worsening of impulsivity. In contrast, when using a quantitative analysis of the general symptoms of ADHD, the data showed no significant difference when comparing placebo with caffeine (standardized mean difference -0.12; 95\% CI -0.44 to 0.20; p = 0.45; I2 = 0\%). (4) Conclusion: overall, the totality of the evidence suggests no significant benefit of caffeine over placebo in the treatment of children with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, has been associated with various structural and functional CNS abnormalities but findings about neurobiological mechanisms linking genes to brain phenotypes are just beginning to emerge. Despite the high heritability of the disorder and its main symptom dimensions, common individual genetic variants are likely to account for a small proportion of the phenotype's variance. Recent findings have drawn attention to the involvement of rare genetic variants in the pathophysiology of ADHD, some being shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Traditionally, neurobiological research on ADHD has focused on catecholaminergic pathways, the main target of pharmacological treatments. However, more distal and basic neuronal processes in relation with cell architecture and function might also play a role, possibly accounting for the coexistence of both diffuse and specific alterations of brain structure and activation patterns. This article aims to provide an overview of recent findings in the rapidly evolving field of ADHD neurobiology with a focus on novel strategies regarding pathophysiological analyses.},
